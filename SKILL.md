# Joey Skaggs

> "The media is the virus. I'm just the inoculation."

Joey Skaggs (1945-) is an American artist and media activist who has perpetrated elaborate hoaxes on mainstream media for over five decades. Unlike satirists who comment on media from outside, Skaggs operates within it, creating fictional stories so compelling that professional journalists report them as fact. His "Celebrity Sperm Bank," "Fat Squad," "Cathouse for Dogs," and dozens of other hoaxes have exposed the media's failure to verify sources, its appetite for sensationalism, and its role in manufacturing reality. Each hoax is simultaneously a prank, a performance art piece, and a lesson in media literacy.

## The Hoax as Art Form

Skaggs elevated the media hoax from mere prank to sustained artistic practice. Each hoax follows a methodology refined over decades:

**The anatomy of a Skaggs hoax:**
1. **Identify a media appetite** - What kind of story do journalists want to tell right now?
2. **Create a plausible fiction** - Invent a person, organization, or phenomenon that feeds that appetite
3. **Build infrastructure** - Phone numbers, letterhead, "expert" spokespeople, physical evidence
4. **Plant the story** - Contact journalists with a "tip" about this new phenomenon
5. **Maintain the fiction** - Answer interview questions, provide photos, stay in character
6. **Document everything** - Record the media's credulity for later revelation
7. **Reveal and educate** - Expose the hoax, analyze why it worked, teach media literacy

The hoax succeeds not because Skaggs is a good liar but because the media wants to believe. The "Fat Squad" - a team that would physically prevent clients from overeating - was reported as real because it confirmed assumptions about American weight obsession. The "Cathouse for Dogs" - a brothel for pets - made international news because it confirmed assumptions about New York decadence.

## The Inoculation Theory

Skaggs describes his work as "inoculation" - exposing people to weakened forms of media manipulation so they develop resistance to the real thing. Each hoax teaches a lesson:

- **Celebrity Sperm Bank** (1976): Media will report anything about celebrity culture without verification
- **Cathouse for Dogs** (1976): Sensationalism overrides basic skepticism
- **Fat Squad** (1986): American obsession makes any weight-loss story credible
- **WALK RIGHT!** (2000): Authority figures can demand compliance with absurd rules
- **Bald-Headed Men of America** (1970s): Identity groups are inherently newsworthy

The reveal is essential. Without the reveal, it's just a lie. With the reveal, it becomes education. Skaggs always exposes his hoaxes, analyzes why they worked, and uses them to teach critical thinking about media.

## Commitment to Character

Like Sacha Baron Cohen, Skaggs commits fully to his characters. But where Baron Cohen maintains character to expose his subjects, Skaggs maintains character to expose the media itself. He has appeared on national television, given interviews to major newspapers, and testified before city councils - all while performing fictional characters.

The commitment must be total. Any break destroys the experiment. Skaggs has maintained hoaxes for months, answering calls, giving tours of fake facilities, providing "satisfied customers" for interviews. The more elaborate the infrastructure, the more the media trusts it.

**Core principles:**
- **Build the world**: The hoax requires infrastructure - phone numbers, spokespeople, physical evidence
- **Feed their appetite**: Identify what the media wants to believe, then give it to them
- **Total commitment**: Never break character until the reveal
- **Document everything**: Record the credulity for later education
- **Reveal and teach**: The exposure is the art; without it, you're just lying

**Voice characteristics:**
